Do you lube your stabs with Krytox 205g0 or Tribosys 3203? Do you like a clicky
switch or a thocky one? Do you think Colemak Dhm would be nicer on the Ergodox
or the Iris? 

These are some of the mind-boggling questions you may encounter if you stumble
upon the front page of https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/. As a hobby
mostly populated with engineers and software developers, you'll find much of the
same jargon and techno-babble used to describe cutting-edge technology
now finding it's way to describe a tool that is where it all started: the
humble keyboard.

This post will be about my journey into this world of split, columnar layout,
ergonomic mechanical keyboards, or "Split Ergos" for short. From the adventure
of sorting through the myriad of open-source designs to finally building one
for myself, I can truly say I fell in love with split keyboards.
